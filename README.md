# Instagram Collections Scraper

* This script will scrape images from your Instagram collection (SAVED images grouped into collections). 

* You'll have to input Instagram USERNAME, PASSWORD & COLLECTION_NAME at appropriate places.

* For carousels only first image will be downloaded as of now. And for video post a screenshot will be downloaded. 

* CAVEAT: To prevent any undesirable consequences make sure you don't leave your instagram username & password on the file after you are done scraping.  

* Note: Don't run all the cells at a go. It somehow prompts for Facebook login when all cells are run at once. Instead run them one at a time - it works.
